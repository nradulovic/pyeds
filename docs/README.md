Building the documentation
==========================

For documentation buildign it is recomended to use virtual environments:

    . bin/activate
    cd docs
    make

Executing the last command will give you a list of available targets for
documentation, for example, executing:

    make html

would generate the HTML documentation in `docs/_build` directory.
