Building the documentation
==========================

For documentation building it is recomended to use virtual environments:

.. code:: console

    . bin/activate
    cd docs
    make

Executing the last command will give you a list of available targets for
documentation. For example, executing:

.. code:: console

    make html

would generate the HTML documentation in `docs/_build` directory.
